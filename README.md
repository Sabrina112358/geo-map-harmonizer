# Geo Map Harmonizer (WIP)

This package includes an algorithm specialized in harmonizing geotiff maps.
Its main function is to generate a harmonized legend based on the spatial 
distribution of classes in two maps, aiming for maximum accuracy in comparison.

Additionally, the package provides data analysis functions for detailed
reports. Specific strategies for handling Big Data are implemented, such as
dividing maps into smaller blocks and consolidatingÂ results.
